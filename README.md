# test_Readdle
Hi, my name Andrew. i'm learning automation qa maybe a half year. 
In my last coffe break (9.6.22) i find your vacancie with test task and for me it's a good challenge. So please give me feedback )

I think selenium so old api :D so im use the next =>
This test created with API playwright

For starting test in your command line enter next:
npm test.
Test running with parameter {headless: true} it's mean test run without automated browser, used only console

After successed test u get screenshoot in your project path.
